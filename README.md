PHP-YAF-PPA
===========

[YAF][1] is a PHP framework written in c and built as a PHP extension.

You could use [ppa][2] to deploy PHP-YAF into your Ubuntu OS easily.

Installing
----------

You must import PPA's key into your system and setup apt's sources.list first.
`add-apt-repository` can help us to take over the fussy job:

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mikespook/php-yaf

Then you should tell your system to pull down the latest list:

	sudo apt-get update

Using `apt-get` to complete the installation:

	sudo apt-get install php-yaf

Build PPA
---------

`build.sh` is a tool for helping build PHP-YAF-PPA.

To use this tool you must install following packages:

	apt install pbuilder debhelper php-dev libpcre3-dev

Type `./build.sh -h` in the terminal, get:

	Usage: build.sh [-v 3.3.2] [-i] [-c focal]
		 -v : Upstream version
		 -i : Index version
		 -c : Distribution's codename [ bionic focal groovy hirsute ]

	========
	Version	Codename
	21.04	Hirsute Hippo
	20.10	Groovy Gorilla
	20.04	Focal Fossa
	18.04	Bionic Beaver

`Upstream version` is YAF release version. Currently, the version is `3.3.2`.
If you want to build previous version, please specify it. 

`Index version` is the version for PPA, pure number required.

`Distribution's codename` is the release name of your Ubuntu. 
Using `lsb_release -c` to detect it.

For example, if want to build a new ppa release for Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) with
the newest YAF version.

	build.sh -v 3.3.2 -i 1 -c focal

Because the latest version of YAF is 3.3.2, in this case, `-v` could be omited.
If your host OS is Ubuntu 20.04, `-c` could be omited too.

After inputting the release note and checked the `changelog`, source.changes
file will be created. Read the [introduction][3] on the launchpad to know why
only source.changes file used.
